## Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)

The **Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E)** measures the relationship between a company’s stock price and its earnings per share (EPS).

The formula is:

```
P/E = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share (annual)
```

The P/E ratio is commonly used to evaluate whether a stock is **overvalued or undervalued**.

- A **high P/E** usually indicates that the stock price is high relative to earnings, suggesting higher growth expectations or overvaluation.
- A **low P/E** often suggests that the stock may be undervalued and potentially more attractive to investors.

In simple terms, the lower the P/E ratio, the higher the potential investment value—assuming other fundamentals are sound.

### Bear Market

A **bear market** refers to a prolonged period of declining stock prices.

Key characteristics:

## Long vs Short Positions

- **Long position**: Buying a stock with the expectation that its price will increase, allowing the investor to sell later at a profit.
- **Short position**: Selling borrowed shares with the expectation that the price will decline, then buying them back at a lower price to profit from the difference.
