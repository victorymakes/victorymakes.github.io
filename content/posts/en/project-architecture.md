## Introduction

While job hunting, I encountered many interview questions.
Some were familiar, some I had seen before but could not articulate clearly, and others were completely unexpected.

One question came up repeatedly:

> **Can you draw and explain the overall architecture of a project you’ve worked on?**

At first, I underestimated this question.
I thought drawing a few boxes and arrows would be enough.
It turned out I was wrong.

## Architecture Diagram: Before

The first time I was asked this question, I explained the system while sketching the diagram.
The result looked something like this—or worse:

This kind of diagram is difficult to understand and does not help the interviewer grasp the system.

## Architecture Diagram: After

After reading books and studying well-designed architecture diagrams from others,
I refined my approach and produced a much clearer result.

The improved diagram:

- Clearly separates responsibilities
- Shows data flow and dependencies
- Highlights key components

A good diagram allows others to understand the system **at a glance**.

## Comparison and Key Takeaways

By comparing the two diagrams and researching best practices, I summarized the value of architecture diagrams
and how to draw them effectively.

## Why Architecture Diagrams Matter

A good architecture diagram helps you:

- Explain a complex system clearly
- Show how components interact
- Highlight key technologies and middleware
- Communicate design decisions efficiently

In interviews, a clear diagram significantly improves how your experience is perceived.

## How to Draw a Good Architecture Diagram

1. **Define the purpose**
   - Business view or technical view?
   - High-level or detailed?

2. **Identify key components**
   - Services
   - Databases
   - Caches
   - Middleware

3. **Choose the right layout**
   - Flow-based
   - Layered
   - Grid or network

4. **Start big, then refine**
   - Draw major modules first
   - Fill in details gradually

## Final Thoughts

Drawing architecture diagrams is a skill that improves with practice.
A well-structured diagram not only reflects your technical understanding
but also your ability to communicate clearly.

In interviews and real-world collaboration alike,
this skill is far more important than it may seem at first.
